<h1> Miss Cocktails </h1>
<p>Welcome to my first React project! This app generates a list of customers and their favorite spirit and cocktail. By clicking on a customer, you can see the full recipe for their favorite drink using the Cocktail API.

One of the features of the app is the use of Chart JS to display how many spirits each customer has consumed. I also implemented React Router and Redux, and learned about both classes and hooks in the process.

This project was a great opportunity for me to practice React and build upon my web development skills. I enjoyed creating the app and learning about all the different technologies that go into building a modern web application.

If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me. Thank you for checking out my project!</p>
